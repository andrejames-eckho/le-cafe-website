# Le Cafe Philippines: Integrated Audio Systems

The digital manifestation of a premium listening lounge. Le Cafe Philippines delivers a "High-End Audio Tech" experience, resulting in a website that feels like a piece of high-performance hardware—tactile, precise, and warm.

## 📻 Design Philosophy: "The Hardware UI"

Inspired by best-in-class audio manufacturers (Teenage Engineering, Sonos, OSD PRO), the UI prioritizes:
- **Macro-Mechanical Storytelling**: High-density specs and "mechanical" layout patterns.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Micro-interactions that mimic the tactile resistance of toggle switches and volume knobs.
- **Vacuum Tube Vibe**: A "Studio Charcoal" and "Rich Umber" palette accented by "Vacuum Tube Glow" (Amber/Orange).

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS-first configuration)
- **Motion**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Analog-feel transitions)
- **Type**: Inter (Sans) & Space Mono (Technical)

## 🛠️ Core Components

- **Hero Sequence**: A "warming up" sequence logic that mimics an amplifier powering on before revealing the brand narrative.
- **SpecCard**: A technical data-sheet component for displaying high-fidelity audio equipment specifications (Speakers, Monitors, Amplifiers).
- **Hardware-Border**: Custom utility classes for recessed, tactile panel borders.
